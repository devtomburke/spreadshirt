React Webpack Example
=====================

Very simple and not yet complete example on how to use webpack and react.

Features shown so far:
----------------------
* Require CSS files from javascript
* Require images from Javascript
* Require JSon from JavaScript
* Use ES6 language features
* Use react dev server with hot reloading

Run:
----
* ```npm install```: To install all dependencies
* ```npm run devserver```: to start Webpack development server
* Point your browser to ```http://localhost:8080``` and enjoy greeting cards :-)
* Change some CSS or JavaScript files and see modifications on the fly. No reloading is necessary.
